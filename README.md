# LD51 Game : Quantum Annihilation
A game jam game for LD51 (jam).

by @mikkojaawalahti, @rajanu, and @yorakki

You control the blue particle with WASD, arrows or mouse/touch. Do not get annihilated by your quantum pair.

Your goal is to harness the cosmic energy and escape through the portal. However, beware, you do not see the full picture. In fact, sometimes the best course of action is to wait. Every 10 seconds you see the situation in new inverse light.
